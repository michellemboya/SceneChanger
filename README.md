# SceneChanger
A simple scene blending together several skyboxes over a three minute period. Skyboxes are blended using Unity's SkyboxBlended Shader. The experience also contains an AutoWalk script for GVR. 
Includes particle systems and scripting to toggle them on and off.
Soundtrack used: "All This Love" by JP Cooper. I do not own this soundtrack. 
Made using GVR SDK and Unity 2017.1.0p4
